## Description

In this project, we built an application that allows users to borrow tools and submit tools for lending. This repo hosts the front-end portion built in React.

## Installation

To install, run `npm install` or go to the deployed application at https://tool-share-site.netlify.app

## Usage

To use the application, first create an account with the username, email, and password. Once the user has signed in, use the nav bar to select to borrow or lend a tool. Clicking on a link will take you to the requisite form that includes the tool type, tool name, tool description, and the associated user. When a user submits a request to borrow, the user who is lending will receive a notification to approve or deny the arrangement.
